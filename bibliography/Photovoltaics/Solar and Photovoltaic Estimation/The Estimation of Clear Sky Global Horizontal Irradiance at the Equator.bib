abstract = {We analyse Singapore global horizontal irradiance (GHI) measurements to estimate clear sky GHI in the equator region. The data consists of a one-year period of clear sky GHI at three solar irradiance monitoring stations in Singapore, namely, First Zero Energy House in Singapore (1.3094∘N, 103.9160∘E) located in the east of the country, Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (1.3007∘N, 103.7718∘E) in the mid-west, and Nanyang Technology University Intelligence Systems Center (1.3436∘N, 103.6792∘E) in the west. Several empirical clear sky models are considered for a Singapore case study. An regression method is proposed to parameterise the model of choice for Singapore's measured GHI. The developed model is validated using GHI measurements from difference stations over different time periods.}
