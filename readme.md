# Awesome Solar and Photovoltaic Energy Forecasting
This repository contains a list of awesome resources for solar and photovoltaic energy (forecasting),
as well as All Sky Imagers (camera installations that capture as much sky as possible). The list is not exhaustive and will be updated regularly. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to contribute.

Research Datasets will be added soon.

Bibliography files can be found in the `bibliography` folder.
